# KeyPass password manager
### (Not to be confused with KeePass)

This is my submission for COMP-10247 final assignment.

The goal is to write an example password manager that allows a user to create encrypted "vaults" holding hashed login information. A user will be able to easily create, retrieve, and update their saved passwords via a command line interface.

## Requirements:

- Store, retrieve, and manage passwords encrypted in a local file that requires a master password to unlock.  
- Options: add, list, search, delete entries.  Could optionally integrate cryptography or keyring.
