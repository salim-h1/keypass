# KeyPass password manager
### (Not to be confused with KeePass)

This is my submission for COMP-10247 final assignment

The goal is to write an example password manager that allows a user to create encrypted "vaults" holding hashed login information

A user will be able to easily create, retrieve, and update their saved passwords via a command line interface
